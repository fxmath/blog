## 2. PROFITABILITY THRESHOLD ANALYSIS

### 2.1 Mathematical Breakeven Calculation

Given:
- Win Rate (WR) = 36.36%
- Risk/Reward = 1:2 (SL=$3, TP=$6)

**Breakeven Cost Formula:**
```
Breakeven Cost = (TP × Win Rate - SL × Loss Rate) / Total Trades
Breakeven Cost = (6 × 0.3636 - 3 × 0.6364)
Breakeven Cost = $0.273 per trade
```
